# LCDJoystickController
Electronics Simple Project #2

This electronics project is building upon my first project, LCD Thermometer. With the same wiring of the LCD, I've replaced the thermistor with a new component (well for me it was new & exciting), which is the thumb joystick component. The code is similar to my first one, having that nice little intro "Joystick X-Y Coordinates" like the "Digital Thermometer" in my first one. Now with the joystick, which has both analog and digital input, I have experimented with different codes to make it as sleek and short as possible. 

I've enjoyed working on this project and I hope this inspires you as well.
